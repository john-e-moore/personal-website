### Hello

I made this website because I want to be able to deploy and maintain my own web apps. I like building things, and while less enjoyable to me than automating flows of information, I am starting to feel limited by my lacking knowledge of front-end, web architecture, and networking.

With that in mind, I chose a stack that would require me to spin up an EC2 instance and install + configure a web server and a reverse proxy without making me really drill into CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, etc.

Here is what I'm using:  

- Hosting: AWS EC2
- Application: Python / Flask / Bootstrap
- Web server: gunicorn
- Reverse proxy: nginx
- DNS: Cloudfare
- Domain registrar: Cloudfare

Most valuable lessons so far:  

- Basic web app structure -- routes, templates, models
- https setup including getting a certificate and configuring both nginx and Cloudfare
- Running gunicorn as a systemd service so that it restarts with the EC2 instance
- Using a UNIX socket for nginx - gunicorn communcation (improves both speed and security)

I am enjoying the design aspect more than I thought I would; I did not use a ready-made template. I was inspired by [Anthopic's Claude page](https://claude.ai/) as well as [Vitalik Buterin's blog](https://vitalik.eth.limo/). Clean look using soft colors that are easy on the eyes, no distractions on the page, minimal clicking. I hope to channel that aesthetic into my writing as well -- clear and concise writing that makes complex topics and thoughts easy to understand.
