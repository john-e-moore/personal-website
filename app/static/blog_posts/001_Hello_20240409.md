Hi, I'm John. After moving on from playing poker full-time in 2020, I landed my first data engineer position in 2021. At the beginning of this year I moved elsewhere and am enjoying applying my skills to economics. 

I have a lot of ideas. And to me, programming is about bringing ideas to life. Pretty quickly I realized that I would need to become more of a generalist if I wanted to share my creations with people.

So, this is the first website I have made. I rented a server and bought the domain and did the whole thingy. Very rewarding experience. I didn't want to take the easiest possible route; I am here to learn the computer stuff after all. I chose a stack that would require me to spin up an EC2 instance and install + configure a web server and a reverse proxy without making me really drill into CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, etc.

I am enjoying the design aspect more than I thought I would. I was inspired by [Anthopic's Claude page](https://claude.ai/) as well as [Vitalik Buterin's blog](https://vitalik.eth.limo/).

Here is what I'm using:  

- Hosting: AWS EC2
- Application: Python / Flask / Bootstrap
- Web server: gunicorn
- Reverse proxy: nginx
- DNS: Cloudfare
- Domain registrar: Cloudfare

Hope you enjoy my writing.

-John
