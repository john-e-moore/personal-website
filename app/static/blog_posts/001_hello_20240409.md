I made this website because I want to be able to build / deploy / maintain my own web apps. I started my first tech role in 2021 as a data engineer at a heirarchical and siloed organization. While I still have more of a passion for end-to-end data pipelines and data management, I realized that to do anything useful by yourself you need a full stack skillset. 

With that in mind, I need to pick up beginner knowledge in front-end, web architecture, and networking, at least. I chose a stack that would require me to spin up an EC2 instance and install + configure a web server and a reverse proxy without making me really drill into CSS, JavaScript, Ajax, etc.

Here is what I'm using:  

- Hosting: AWS EC2
- Application: Python / Flask / Bootstrap
- Web server: gunicorn
- Reverse proxy: nginx
- DNS: Cloudfare
- Domain registrar: Cloudfare

I am enjoying the design aspect more than I thought I would. I was inspired by [Anthopic's Claude page](https://claude.ai/) as well as [Vitalik Buterin's blog](https://vitalik.eth.limo/). The way I think about educational content: start with the assumption (realization?) that your audience has almost none of your tacit knowledge and make your content clean, simple, and easy to understand. This goes for writing, graphs, visual aids, code, and anything else that exists to convey information to an audience.
